#### a complex build template.
https://github.com/miguno/kafka-storm-starter/blob/develop/build.sbt


#### install sbt in linux
wget http://apt.typesafe.com/repo-deb-build-0002.deb
sudo dpkg -i repo-deb-build-0002.deb
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install sbt

#### problems happened in sbt
there is a lock when sbt analyse the build.sbt and download jar.
sometimes deadlock if multiply project created and wait for each other.

if you re-create a project, must delete other content in project/out/.idea.
otherwise old project remains may confuse sbt and scala compiler. report error.
